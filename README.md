- 👋 Hi, I’m David Chester
- 👀 After a decade as an integrated producer, I'm on a journey to become a fulltime iOS developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift, UIKit and iOS development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, prototype projects, or anything I can help out and learn from.
- 📫 How to reach me find me on twitter @_DavidChester or my email david.chester4@gmail.com

I’ve decided to switch careers for multiple reasons, but one of the main reasons was to work on products that help enrich people’s lives. Building tools to accelerate their own growth, creating new ways to collaborate, or making their lives easier by giving them greater accessibility to what they love. 

Earlier this year I released my first app onto the App Store (linked above) and continue to build and iterate on it. An app where users are given the times of the rise and set times of the sun and moon plus the length of the day with a tap of the location button. This was fun to build as it taught me to work with a user’s location, make a call to the ipgeolocation.io api, and formatting for the user’s local date and time. I’m excited to push that further, extending it as a widget as well as an Apple Watch app. But one of the most rewarding parts of working on it is revisiting and refactoring.

Taking my experience further I’ve had the opportunity to volunteer with the non-profit Heartsupport. Working with their lead iOS engineer to develop the MVP of their first crisis-prevention app aimed at connecting users who are feeling at risk with available supporters. From building out the user login and registration pages to networking with their firebase and internal servers. This has been an incredibly rewarding experience both personally and professionally.

I continue to push myself with architecture, concentrating on MVC and MVVM. My goals are to continue to learn the fundamentals, develop good habits and push myself to include practices like dependency integration. I hope to continue to build out my GitHub portfolio to show the different types of projects I’m working on. Whether the early stages of an Autograph project where users can take a photo and add a signature before being saved to CoreData, or a project utilizing MapKit which would let users build personalized maps to keep track of their favorite pizza places (because that’s the only travel list that really matters right?).

Working in advertising has taught me that each project is a learning opportunity. I enjoy researching vendors, new technologies, and staying on top of current trends. Getting inspired by new ideas to test out new ways of working to help shape future projects and push the work I do with others to stand out. I am a person who is not afraid to lead projects, evangelize for new ideas, and is inherently curious about new ways to achieve goals.
